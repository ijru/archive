<h1>IJRU &mdash; International Jump Rope Union</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  IJRU was announced in 2018 as a result of the merger of the
  <a href="../fisac-irsf/">International Rope Skipping Federation</a> and the
  <a href="../wjrf/">World Jump Rope Federation</a>
</p>

<h2>Web Presence</h2>
<p>
  IJRU originally launched their website in mid-2018 on <a
  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180521233950/http://www.ijru.org/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  >http://ijru.org</a> fragments of which can be found on the Internet Archive.
</p>

<p>
  The IJRU Technical Committee shortly thereafter launched it's web presence on
  <a href="https://tc.ijru.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  >https://tc.ijru.org</a> mid-October 2018. Where updates about the
  developing IJRU Rules were published.
</p>

<p>
  Around May-July 2019 the Technical Committee site replaced the main IJRU site
  as they were unified under <a href="https://ijru.sport"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ijru.sport</a>
